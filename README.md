# About

This program uses the The Cat API to get facts for a specific cat breed.

Running `node index.js Chartreux` in the terminal will return the following result:

`The Chartreux is generally silent but communicative. Short play sessions, mixed with naps and meals are their perfect day. Whilst appreciating any attention you give them, they are not demanding, content instead to follow you around devotedly, sleep on your bed and snuggle with you if youâ€™re not feeling well.`
